[xdg-sound -- release notes.  2020-05-09]: #

Stable Release 1.0
==================

This is the first stable release of the xdg-sound package that provides
"C"-language programs and utilities for working with (locating and
playing) event sound files from XDG sound themes.

This release is a stable release that provides the location tools and
the ability to play the file; however, display of sound data is not yet
supported.  The ability to list and play files is mature and very
usable.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xdg-sound/issues).
