=head1 NAME

xdg-snd-which - show the full path of XDG sound entries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xdg-snd-which> [I<OPTIONS>] [--] I<SOUND> [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xdg-snd-which> takes one or more arguments.  For each of its
arguments, it prints to standard output the full path of the sound file
that would have been played when this argument had been supplied to
L<xdg-play(1)>.  It does this by searching for a sound entry in the
appropriate sub-directories of the C<XDG_DATA_DIRS> and C<XDG_DATA_HOME>
environment variables using the same algorithms as L<xdg-play(1)>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The program accepts the following arguments:

=over

=item I<SOUND>

Specifies the event identifier of an XDG sound to locate.  The event
identifier can be one of the following:

=over

=item 1.

The name of a sound file without any sound-file-specific extension (e.g.
F<.ogg>) suffix (e.g. F<system-bootup>); the name may contain a C</> if
it is specified relative to a user or system application directory, in
which case it must not start with a C</> or C<.>.

B<xdg-sound-which> is a script that simply executes L<xdg-play(1)> with

See L<xdg-sound(1)/COMMAND OPTIONS> for more information.
