0.9             Preliminary Release 0.9

    This is a preliminary release of the xdg-sound package that provides
    "C"-language programs and utilities for working with (locating and
    playing) event sound files from XDG sound themes.

    This release is a preliminary release that provides the location tools
    and the ability to play the file; however, display of sound data is not
    yet supported.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
